# Maps

These are the [GIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_system) (Geographic Information System) files generated as part of the project.

There are five downloads for each 'shapefile' (a way of storing geographic information). All five files will need to be downloaded into the same directory. The [shapefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile) (.shp) can then be opened in GIS software, like QGIS.

## Building outlines (Shapefiles)

Outlines of buildings corresponding to the 1910 valuations Ordnance Survey map in shapefile format.
