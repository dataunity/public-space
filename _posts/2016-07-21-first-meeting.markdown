We met in the iconic Wills Building yesterday to kick off the Public Space project. We discussed the themes we'd like to explore and how to share the Public Space work with other organisations, like Bristol Records Office and the City Council.

There's already been a lot of valuable work done in mapping Bristol through projects like [Know Your Place](http://maps.bristol.gov.uk/knowyourplace/) which we want to build on and enhance.

In the meeting we had Professor Antonia Layard (Bristol University Law Department), Julian Warren (Bristol Records Office), Pete Insole (Bristol City Council), Andrew Ventham (Bristol City Council, GIS, Alex Craven (freelance historian) and Kev Kirkland ([Data Unity](http://www.dataunity.org/)).
